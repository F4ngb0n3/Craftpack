# Craftpack Recipes

The recipes in **Craftpack** are quite simple, and follow the same basic structure for building all of the available packs that are open to your players. There will be a **3x3 Grid** display of the items, similar to the what you would see when crafting in a Crafting Table in Minecraft. Simply follow the placement and you will have yourself a nifty new pack!
